                MOBILE APPS/WEBSITE TERMS OF USE
                Welcome to CNN!
                FIRST, AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE: PLEASE READ THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF USE ("Terms", "Terms of Use", or
                "Agreement") CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THIS SITE, AS THEY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS,
                INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WAIVERS OF RIGHTS, LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, AND YOUR INDEMNITY TO US.
                THIS AGREEMENT REQUIRES THE USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN
                COURTS OR JURY TRIALS, AND LIMITS THE REMEDIES AVAILABLE IN THE EVENT OF A DISPUTE.
                These Terms of Use describe the terms and conditions that govern your use of the current and future
                online and mobile websites, platforms, services, applications, and networks owned or operated by Cable
                News Network, Inc. ("CNN"), including without limitation, CNN.com, HLNtv.com, CNNI.com (edition.cnn.com)
                and cnnespanol.com, and/or for which CNN currently or in the future provides services and/or technology
                (the "Site" or "Sites"). You accept and agree to be bound by these Terms of Use when you use any of the
                Sites, without limitation, when you view or access content or videos on any of the Sites.
                (A) Governing Terms. These Terms of Use, along with any additional terms and conditions that are
                referenced herein or that are presented elsewhere on the Site in relation to a specific service or
                feature and the CNN Privacy Policy, set forth the terms and conditions that apply to your use of the
                CNN.com Site. By using the Site, you agree to comply with all of the terms and conditions hereof. If you
                do not agree to these Terms of Use, you should not access or use the Site.
                (B) Changes to Terms of Use. CNN may modify the Terms of Use, or any part thereof, or add or remove
                terms at any time, and such modifications, additions or deletions will be effective immediately upon
                posting. Your use of the Site after such posting shall be deemed to constitute acceptance by you of such
                modifications, additions or deletions.
